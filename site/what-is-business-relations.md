# What is Business Relations?

Business relations describes the partnerships and collaborations between Vocational Rehabilitation (VR) agencies and employers. The focus is on understanding a company's workforce needs and connecting them with qualified job seekers with disabilities. Building these relationships goes beyond filling open positionsâ€”it's about creating long-term value for both the business and the individuals we serve.
