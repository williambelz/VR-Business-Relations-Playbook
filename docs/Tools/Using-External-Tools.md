# Guidelines for Using External Tools

This section is for documenting specific tools and code snippets found from external resources. When a useful tool is identified from our [External Resources list](../Resources/External-Resources.md), add a section here explaining how it can be used in our VR workflow.

## Template for a New Tool

### Tool Name: [Name of the Tool]
* **Link:** [Link to the tool or repository]

* **How to Use:** [Provide a step-by-step guide or best practices for using it.]

### Tool Name: AI-Powered Resume Scanner
* **Link:** [Link to a specific tool found on GitHub]
* **Purpose:** To help quickly identify candidate skills that match a job description and to check our own clients' resumes for compatibility with Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS).
* **How to Use:** [Instructions on how to upload a resume and job description, and how to interpret the results.]
* **Ethical Considerations:** This tool should be used to augment, not replace, human judgment. We must review the results for potential bias against non-traditional career paths.
